# 5. Scrutinizing Behavior Layering: Critiques and Tradeoffs of BedazzleJS

Every new pattern deserves a little healthy skepticism. While **BedazzleJS** and **Progressive Behavior Layering** offer a flexible, composable approach to object construction, they aren't without tradeoffs.

In this article, we put on the skeptic hat and give Behavior Layering a hard look. What are its limitations? Where might traditional patterns still make more sense? Let's dive in.

## “Isn’t This Just Fancy Mixins?”

**Challenge:** Aren’t we just doing what mixins have always done — merging in methods?

**Response:** Yes, it shares some DNA with mixins. But there are important differences:
- Behavior functions ("beads") are **pure** — no prototype patching or mutation.
- **Ordering is explicit and predictable**.
- No name collisions unless you intentionally overlap.
- Decorators can be applied **at runtime**, not just at object creation.

The mechanism feels familiar, but the execution is more flexible and functional.

## “Why Invent a New Term? Isn’t This Just Composition?”

**Challenge:** Composition isn’t new. Ramda, Lodash, functional programming — this is old news.

**Response:** Absolutely — for **data transformation.** But BedazzleJS applies composition to **object behaviors** (methods and properties), not just values.

Most function composition tools don’t help you assemble **capabilities** onto objects progressively.

## “Doesn’t All This Spreading and Merging Hurt Performance?”

**Challenge:** Aren’t we paying for all these spread operations (`...obj`) at every step?

**Response:** Object spreading isn’t free, but:
- No worse than cloning in factory functions.
- Behavior Layering is intended for **config objects, feature flags, plugin systems** — not for performance-critical math operations or tight loops.
- Gains **clarity and flexibility**, often worth the small performance cost.

If you’re working on a high-performance, real-time graphics engine? Stick with prototypes. Otherwise, the tradeoff is often negligible.

## “Won’t This Break Down in Complex Object Relationships?”

**Challenge:** This seems fine for simple objects. Can it handle more complex systems?

**Response:** Behavior Layering works best when behaviors are **modular and loosely coupled.**

If your design depends on **deep inheritance trees, circular references, or complex interdependencies**, classical OOP may still serve you better. BedazzleJS isn’t trying to replace inheritance everywhere — just where inheritance gets awkward.

## “I Like Knowing Where My Methods Live — Prototypes Make That Clear.”

**Challenge:** Prototypes separate data from methods. This smashes them together into plain objects.

**Response:** True. Bedazzle trades prototype chains for **simplicity and runtime flexibility.**

It shines in situations where:
- You don’t care about strict prototype hierarchies.
- You want behaviors to be **configurable, replaceable, and composable.**

If prototype optimization is critical, Bedazzle might not be your tool.

---

## “Why Should I Trust This Weird Pattern Over Battle-Tested Classes and Factories?”

**Challenge:** Classes and factories are familiar. Why learn this?

**Response:** Because classes and factories often **lock you into early decisions.**

Behavior Layering lets your objects **grow and evolve at runtime.** This makes it great for:
- **Plugin systems.**
- **Feature flags.**
- **Dynamic configuration.**
- **Middleware-style layering.**

It’s not about replacing classes and factories everywhere — it’s about offering a new tool for when they start to creak.

## Honest Conclusion: Know Your Tradeoffs

Behavior Layering isn’t the right hammer for every nail. But when you need flexibility, modularity, and runtime growth, BedazzleJS offers a clean, functional approach.

Understand the tradeoffs. Choose the right tool for the job. And if Behavior Layering fits your use case, it might just surprise you.
