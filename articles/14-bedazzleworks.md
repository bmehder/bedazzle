## BedazzleWorks Launches the Future of Behavior Composition: BedazzleJS

**SAN FRANCISCO, CA — BedazzleWorks™, the world’s leading Behavior Augmentation™ company, today announced the general availability of BedazzleJS**, a 7-line JavaScript function poised to redefine how developers structure, extend, and emotionally connect with their code.

“After billions in funding and countless hours studying mixin trauma, we’re proud to unveil a solution so elegant, it could have been written by a bored intern,” said Gene Flexman, CEO of BedazzleWorks. “BedazzleJS empowers teams to deliver method-level agility with glitter-level confidence.”

## 🧠 Mission Statement
> At BedazzleWorks, we believe in layering behavior — and value — one tiny function at a time.

From the smallest startup to the largest megachurch-themed SaaS provider, BedazzleJS delivers scalable, immutable, order-sensitive behavior composition for everyone. Whether you’re building a to-do list or refactoring a microservices monolith into a single object with `increment()`, BedazzleJS meets you where you are — and makes you 40% more emotionally fulfilled.

## 📈 Key Features
- Immutable layer stacking
- Functional override safety
- Middleware-grade method chaining
- Fits in a tweet

## 🌐 Availability
BedazzleJS is available immediately via npm, CDN, telepathy, or from that one engineer who always copies things into Notion.
