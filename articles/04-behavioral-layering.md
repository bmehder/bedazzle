# 4. Progressive Behavior Layering: A New Take on Composition with BedazzleJS

Most JavaScript developers know how to compose **functions**. Tools like `compose`, `pipe`, or method chaining make it easy to transform data one step at a time.

But what about **composing objects**?

What if adding a feature like `getArea()` or `log()` could feel as natural as composing functions â€” not by subclassing, not by patching prototypes, not by bundling everything into one rigid factory â€” but by **layering behaviors onto objects, one piece at a time, exactly when you need them**?

This is what **BedazzleJS** makes possible. Itâ€™s a small library with one big idea:

> ðŸ’Ž **Behavior Layering** â€” progressively decorating objects with pure functions that add methods and properties, composable at runtime.

## Behavior Layering vs. Inheritance and Factories

In traditional JavaScript patterns, your options for sharing behavior look something like this:

- âœ… **Classes and inheritance**: Define shared methods on a prototype chain.
- âœ… **Factory functions**: Build objects with methods baked in at construction time.
- âœ… **Mixins**: Patch behaviors across objects or classes.

Each of these comes with tradeoffs:

- Inheritance gets messy as your feature list grows.
- Factories require advance planning (what if you need to add a feature later?).
- Mixins risk name collisions and tangled logic.

**Behavior Layering** offers another way:

- ðŸ’Ž **Small, pure functions.**
- ðŸª© **Applied at runtime, in any order.**
- ðŸš« **No mutation of prototypes.**
- ðŸ§© **Composable like functions â€” but for objects.**

## How Behavior Layering Works

Hereâ€™s the basic idea. Each "layer" of behavior is just a function that takes an object (state) and returns an object with new properties or methods:

> *You may have heard the Lego metaphor in functional programming â€” reusable pieces that click together to build bigger things. In the spirit of Bedazzle, we think of these behaviors as ************â€˜beadsâ€™************ instead: simple, self-contained functions you string together onto your objects as they grow.*

```javascript
const withArea = ({ width, height }) => ({
  getArea: () => width * height,
});

const withPerimeter = ({ width, height }) => ({
  getPerimeter: () => 2 * (width + height),
});
```

You can layer these onto your base object using **BedazzleJS**:

```javascript
import { bedazzle } from 'bedazzlejs';

const rectangle = bedazzle(
  { width: 5, height: 10 },
  withArea,
  withPerimeter
);

console.log(rectangle.getArea());      // 50
console.log(rectangle.getPerimeter()); // 30
```

Each behavior is independent, reusable, and testable. Need a new feature? Just add another *bead*.

## Why Not Just Use Lodash or Ramda?

Libraries like **Ramda** and **Lodash** excel at composing functions and transforming data. But they don't offer tools for **composing object behaviors** like this.

- Lodash's `mixin` mutates objects and prototypes.
- Ramda's `merge` tools handle data shape, not behavior.

BedazzleJS is about **behavior composition** â€” layering capabilities onto objects progressively, without mutation, and without predefining all features up front.

---

## Functional Decoration, Reimagined

In traditional design patterns, the **decorator pattern** often means wrapping objects, or mutating them directly. BedazzleJS flips that idea:

- âœ… No wrapping.
- âœ… No mutation.
- âœ… Just pure functions that return partial objects.

Bedazzle simply merges the results of these functions onto your object, layer by layer.

> ðŸª© *Think of each behavior like a bead you add to a bracelet â€” each one snapping into place, no tangles.*

## Why This Pattern Hasn't Been Common in JavaScript

Despite how natural Behavior Layering feels once you see it, this pattern hasnâ€™t been common in JavaScript â€” until now.

### JavaScriptâ€™s OOP Roots

JavaScript's prototype system and later ES6 classes encouraged inheritance and constructor functions as the go-to methods for sharing behavior. Factory functions offered a less hierarchical option but still required defining all behavior at creation time.

### Mixins as a Workaround

Mixins emerged to patch behavior onto objects, but they often lead to name collisions, tangled dependencies, and unclear ordering.

### Functional Composition Focused on Data, Not Behavior

While functional programming libraries like Ramda and Lodash popularized function composition and data transformation, they didnâ€™t extend those ideas to behavior composition for objects.

BedazzleJS fills this gap: bringing the spirit of function composition into the world of object capabilities.

---

## Parallels in Other Languages and Paradigms

The idea of composing behaviors isn't new globally â€” just underexplored in JavaScript.

### Traits (Rust, Scala, PHP)

Traits allow behavior sharing without inheritance, avoiding many classic OOP pitfalls. BedazzleJS echoes this approach but does it through pure functions instead of language-level constructs.

### Role Composition (Perl, Scala)

Roles are another pattern for behavior reuse, offering flexibility and avoiding the diamond problem. Again, BedazzleJS achieves similar benefits using small functions and object merging.

### Decorator Pattern (OOP Design Patterns)

Traditional decorators often rely on wrapping objects. BedazzleJS borrows the decorator idea but sidesteps wrapping entirely by layering behaviors directly onto plain objects.

### Middleware Chaining (Express, Koa, Redux)

Middleware is a familiar pattern in JavaScript for composing request handlers or reducers. BedazzleJS applies a similar layering concept â€” but for building objects themselves.

This makes BedazzleJS feel familiar, yet fresh.

## The Punchline: Itâ€™s Just a Tiny Function

With all this talk about behavior layering, you might expect a big, complex library. But hereâ€™s the kicker:

**BedazzleJS is just a small, elegant function.**

Hereâ€™s the entire core of BedazzleJS:

```javascript
export function bedazzle(state, ...fns) {
  const reducer = (obj, fn) => ({
    ...obj,
    ...fn(obj, newState => bedazzle(newState, ...fns)),
  });
  return fns.reduce(reducer, state);
}
```

The entire idea of progressive, runtime behavior composition comes from a few simple lines of code â€” yet unlocks an entirely new way to think about object construction in JavaScript.

You bring the **seed** â€” your base object.
Bedazzle layers on the **beads** â€” small, composable behavior functions.
The result? Behavior that grows with your needs, one bead at a time.

If you've ever wished your objects could grow as gracefully as your function chains, give BedazzleJS a try.

```bash
npm install bedazzlejs
```
